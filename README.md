Jenkins CI Pipeline with Java Application

ðŸ”¹ Project Description

This project demonstrates a *Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline* for a Java application using *Jenkins*.  
Continuous Integration helps streamline delivery by integrating code frequently, detecting issues early, and delivering software faster with greater confidence.

ðŸ”¹Features

- *Automated pipeline* for Java application
- *Continuous Integration* with webhook triggering
- *Automated builds and testing* upon new code commits
- *Jenkins pipeline view* for easy monitoring
- *Scalable and reliable delivery process* for your application

ðŸ”¹Technologies Used

- *Jenkins* (Continuous Integration server)
- *OpenJDK 17* (Java platform)
- *Git and GitHub webhook* for automated triggering
- *Jenkinsfile* for pipeline configuration

ðŸ”¹Workflow (Concept)

1. The developer pushes code to the Git repository.
2. A webhook notifies Jenkins of the new commit.
3. Jenkins pulls the updated code from Git.
4. The pipeline performs automated build, test, and deploy phases.
5. The team can view pipeline progress and results directly in Jenkinsâ€™ console.

ðŸ”¹Conclusion

This pipeline helps enable a reliable and automated delivery process for your Java application, reducing manual intervention, improving code quality, and strengthening team collaboration.
